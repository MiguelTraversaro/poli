    Parsed is a company built in order to bring efficiency in business operations of companies. We provide the alignment between business stakeholders, AI and employees, working as an AI core to produce autonomous agents. 
    Our objective is to enable companies to create 10x use cases from the same dataset, being able to have fully automated systems which enable for automations to take place.
    From the beginning we helped companies customize AI open source models to leverage from using the amount of information they have available in daily uses, at the end we helped them choose between having internal bots, external bots or automations. 
    Our mission is to onboard companies into AI by providing initial workshops that change the way employees think to leverage on AI. 

    We provide the no code workspace to create intuitive pre-trained AI models with company‚Äôs data and build 10x use cases with the same set.

    We help business include AI in their daily workload by providing a platform to centralize creations, prompts, interface to chat and integrate your context while enabling collaboration. This creates synergies to increase the productivity of your employees because they have the place to learn how to make AI useful in manual tasks by building autonomus agents that perform independent operations in a safe environment.

    Building the rails to enable prompt intelligence for business operations of the future.
